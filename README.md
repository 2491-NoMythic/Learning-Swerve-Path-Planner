# Learning-Swerve-Path-Planner
this is for the preseason work done before the 2023-24 season.

Over Winter Break 2023, we are having a meeting with Royce - who has graduated - and several returning programming members. This Repository is where all documents from this project go.

The goals for this project are: 
  - What might the new libraries change about our swerve code (research this together, make code with new libraries)   
  - Have Royce teach us...
      - tuning speeds and angles for SwerveModules (changing values in constants)
      - tuning autos on PathPlanner (changing values in constants)
